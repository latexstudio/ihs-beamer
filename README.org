** Installation

You need to make the files of the template available to your local TeX installation.  For most people, installing in their home directory is the easiest solution.

Executing
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME
#+END_SRC
in the command line will tell you your TeX home directory, which is usually =~/texmf/= or something similar.  You might want to make a subdirectory inside that to keep things tidy, eg
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex/beamer/
#+END_SRC
Then you can
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd ~/texmf/tex/latex/beamer/
#+END_SRC
and get the template following one of the two options below.

*** Git

This is the suggested method, especially if you have git installed.
